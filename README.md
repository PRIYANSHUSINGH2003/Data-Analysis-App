## üìÇ Code Explanation

Here‚Äôs a brief explanation of how the main components of the project work:

### 1. **Home Menu Navigation**
The user can navigate between different sections using the `option_menu` from the `streamlit_option_menu` library:

```python
selected_option = option_menu(
    menu_title="Main Menu",
    options=["Home", "Stock Analysis", "Cancer Predict", "Protein Structure", "Cryptocurrency Price", "Chatbot", "Contact"],
    icons=["house", "bar-chart", "stethoscope", "dna", "bitcoin", "robot", "envelope"],
    menu_icon="cast",
    default_index=0,
)
```
This dynamically generates a side menu where users can select different options to interact with the features of the app.

### 2. **Stock Analysis Module**
This module fetches stock data and visualizes it using Plotly. It leverages real-time data to show stock trends and predictions:

```python
fig = px.line(stock_data, x="Date", y="Close", title="Stock Price Over Time")
st.plotly_chart(fig)
```
`Plotly` is used to create an interactive chart that allows the user to explore stock data over time.

### 3. **Cancer Prediction Module**
A pre-trained machine learning model is loaded using `pickle5`, and the user can upload a CSV file containing patient data for predictions:

```python
with open('cancer_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)

# Load user input data
input_data = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
predictions = model.predict(input_data)
st.write(predictions)
```
The model predicts cancer outcomes based on user-inputted data, which is processed and displayed on the interface.

### 4. **Protein Structure Module**
This module helps users explore protein structures visually:

```python
image = Image.open("protein_structure.png")
st.image(image, caption="3D Protein Structure")
```
Here, **PIL** is used to render an image of a protein structure, allowing the user to interactively explore it.

### 5. **Cryptocurrency Price Module**
This module tracks cryptocurrency prices in real-time, and displays trends using **Plotly**:

```python
crypto_fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Candlestick(x=crypto_data['Date'],
                                            open=crypto_data['Open'],
                                            high=crypto_data['High'],
                                            low=crypto_data['Low'],
                                            close=crypto_data['Close'])])
st.plotly_chart(crypto_fig)
```
The chart allows users to track price changes and view historical trends of selected cryptocurrencies.

### 6. **Chatbot**
The AI-powered chatbot is integrated using a simple Python function, making it a helpful tool for the user:

```python
def chatbot_response(user_input):
    response = "Your chatbot response here!"
    return response

st.write(chatbot_response(st.text_input("Chat with our assistant!")))
```
The chatbot assists users with queries about the app‚Äôs features and data analytics.

### 7. **Data Profiling**
Users can upload datasets and generate a detailed profiling report using `ydata_profiling`:

```python
if uploaded_file:
    df = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
    profile = ProfileReport(df)
    st_profile_report(profile)
```
This feature enables users to perform a comprehensive analysis of their dataset, including data distribution, missing values, and correlations.
